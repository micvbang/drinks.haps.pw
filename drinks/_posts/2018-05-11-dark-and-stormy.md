## Ingredients
- 2 parts dark rum
- 8 parts ginger beer
- 2 quarters of a lime fruit
- 1-3 drops of Angostura

## Notes
- Dark rum can be e.g. Plantation Barbados, Gosling's Black Seal, or whatever discount version. While it makes for a better drink with good rums, getting the right ginger beer and real lemons makes the largest difference.
- The ginger beer is super important. Find one that is somewhat sweet.

## Procedure
1. Pour rum and ginger beer in serving glass
2. Squeeze both quarters of the lime fruit in the serving glass. Throw one away and put one in the glass as garnish
3. Add Angostura to taste
4. Stir
5. Enjoy
